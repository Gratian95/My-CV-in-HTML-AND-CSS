As it names says, this course was about the front-end side of building a website, more specific, about HTML and CSS. You can check my certificate <a href="https://www.pirple.com/certificates/gc67zn4cdj" target="_blank">here. </a> Now, I started learning Javascript in order to have a more comprehesive knowledge on front-end sector. I think that I have a basic front-end knowledge for an internship job or an entry-level job. </td>
